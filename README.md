# XboxConsole  
XboxConsole makes it easy to programmatically control the Xbox One developer and test consoles. The core purpose for creating XboxConsole is to enable developers who prefer to write their development and test tooling with managed code.  
  
Weâ€™ve designed XboxConsole to be backward compatible allowing developers to write tools that can work with titles across different versions of the XDK without rebuilding. Additionally, XboxConsole provides a more familiar, logical representation of the underlying XDK XTF native APIs to make controlling the console a straight forward experience.  
  
XboxConsole is based upon the Xbox Developer Kit (XDK) which is available to anyone who has enrolled in one of several programs to develop or publish with Microsoft. More information can be found here: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers.  
  
Latest XDK supported: March 2017
